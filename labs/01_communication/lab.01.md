# Lab 01: Communication Exercise  

## Goals
* Train you skills to communicate software architectures to third parties without previous knowledge

## Tasks
* Find yourself in groups of three 
* Each team member describes a (large) software program you have implemented or are familiar with 
    * This could be a project you have been involved in, your Bachelor thesis project or an open source project you are familiar with
    * Describe briefly the functionality/purpose of the program 
    * Describe the size, technology, customers of the program 
    * Try to draft the architecture of the program
    * Use whatever tools you feel convenient  
* Choose one tool which you consider as the most interesting for the whole course 
* One team member presents this program to the rest of the class
* **Restrictions**: You must not describe your own project, it has to be one of the programs presented by your team members. 

### Submission

* Create a short presentation about the software you are going to describe 
* It should be at most three slides/pages
* Assume this is an "internal" meeting, you don't require any introduction yourself etc. 
* Upload the presentation to the corresponding ILIAS exercise

### The presentation should not be more than 5 minutes** 
* Try to focus on the main aspects of the software system you describe 
* Your audience should get the idea of the main structure/architecture of the program 
* Your audience should be able to create a similar program based on the pitch you provided

## What you will train
* You will learn how to communicate an software architecture to an audience without any previous knowledge about it 
* You will learn about the right level of abstraction to be used
