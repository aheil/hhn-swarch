# C4 Model Assignment

## Scenario

The overall system considered, is a electronic health record application, developed by your team. Users of the system are internal employees of the health insurance agencies. The users access a web application, written in Java and Spring Boot. Interaction takes place via HTTPS. The web application provides static content as well as a single page application (SPA) written in Microsoft Blazor. This SPA in turn does provide the overall functionality in a web browser. The users do use the SPA via HTTPS. The SPA does use an API application based on Go in Docker containers. Due to their number, the containers are managed by Kubernetes. The Kubernetes cluster is maintained by your central IT department. The API application provides the overall accounting functionality by providing a synchronous JSON/HTTPS based API. This functionality is based on an SAP R/3 System connected asynchronously using RFC (Remote Function Call). The SAP System is a system of the particular health insurance, using a dedicated e-mail server not hosted by your organization. This Microsoft Exchange Server does send out a daily report to the customers. External auditors access the reporting functionality of the SAP system using a data warehouse system based on a DB2 system to the SAP system using a proprietary SQL implementation.
